## The Beginning: A Dream Too Ambitious?

I never grew up thinking Harvard was an option. It was a name uttered with respect, something for the untouchably intelligent only. I was in awe, but being included in it somehow felt distant—something to dream about, toward a star, knowing it was light-years away.  

I was never, though, one to step away from the impossible.

## Opportunities After Opportunities  

From the very day I made up my mind to specialize in education technology, I knew that I was going to have to work harder than anyone else. I plunged headlong into every hurdle that I could find—learning, building, networking, falling, and then rising again. I taught myself to code, experimented with AI-powered education models, and pushed the boundaries of what I thought I could accomplish.  

I worked on EdTech projects that bridged accessibility gaps, hoping to create something that would truly matter. Every project, every all-nighter, and every rejection letter pushed me closer to understanding what it would take to make a difference—not as a student, but as a leader of education innovation.

## The Hardest Part: Losing People, Finding Myself  

No one talks about the loneliness that comes with seeking something higher than yourself. There were individuals along the way that I lost—whom I loved. Some departed. Some drifted away. Some did not understand why I was working so hard for something that was not even guaranteed.  

There were moments when I wanted to give up—not because I was not capable of it, but because it all appeared too overwhelming to cope with. There were moments when I doubted myself and asked if I was good enough—if maybe I was just another dreamer who would never get there.  

Depression hit hard, like a filthy intruder. I was straining to ascend, on my own, against a storm that refused to relent. But in the black depths, I would remind myself: **I didn't come this far to come just this far.**  

So I pressed on. Another application, one more research paper, another night grueling along.

## The Moment That Changed Everything  

Then came the day—the Harvard email.  

I had before been rejected from schools such as the one at Harvard. I had experienced firsthand the letdown of having to refresh an inbox to face disappointment. But this time… this time, it was different.  

> **"Congratulations! We are delighted to present you with acceptance to Harvard's Master's in Learning Design, Innovation, and Technology."**  

I read them again, then a third time. And then, I allowed myself a moment to catch my breath. I allowed myself to believe.  

This was not just an acceptance letter. This was **confirmation**—of all the sacrifices, setbacks, and late nights I tossed and turned, wondering if it was all worth it.  

It was.

## What Comes Next  

Harvard admission wasn't the end—it was merely the beginning of something far greater. Today, I enter a world where I can convert ideas into impact, where I can extend the boundaries of learning and technology.  

And if there is one thing that I've learned from all of this, it's this:  

> **The road will break you before it makes you. But if you won’t give up, if you just keep going through the storm, you will stand in the place you once believed was impossible.**  

Harvard was once a pipe dream. Now, it's my reality. And if I can do it, **so can you.**
