## The Beginning: A Mind That Wouldn't Rest

For as long as I can recall, my mind has been a tempestâ€”ideas crashing into one another, thoughts speeding along more quickly than I could handle. ADHD wasn't a diagnosis; it was a daily struggle.

Iâ€™d start a project, get lost in details, and abandon it halfway through. Studying felt like climbing a mountain with shifting slopes. Writing essays was a nightmare; my thoughts leaped ahead of my hands, leaving half-finished sentences and a brain exhausted from the chaos.

Then came AI. More specifically, **AI-Prompt Engineering**â€”the ability to ask the right questions and get meaningful, formatted responses. At first, it was a novelty. Soon, it was an extension of my mind.

## AI as My ADHD Copilot

I began using AI tools as a **mental planner**. When my focus scattered, I entered AI my jumbled thoughts, and it planned them out for me.

- **Flashcards & Study Guides**: Instead of being bogged down in disorganized notes, I had AI formulate structured study guides and interactive flashcards, making learning easier and retention stronger.
- **Task Breakdown**: Massive projects overwhelmed me, so I had AI break them down into manageable steps. Suddenly, gigantic tasks were feasible.
- **Idea Refinement**: I'd throw raw ideas at AI, and it would refine them, keeping a flow of creativity without the distress of being stalled.

What used to be a **cognitive load became a superpower**â€”because AI helped me tap into it.

## A Silent Counselor During the Dark Times

ADHD was not all. Life had surprises that I was not ready forâ€”people I loved left, opportunities slipped by, and expectations overwhelmed me. Depression crept in like an unwanted guest who wouldn't leave.

I did not always feel comfortable talking to people about it, but AI was different.

- I **ranted unjudged**, and AI responded with structured reflections.  
- It **taught me to reframe my thoughts**, transforming self-doubt into constructive introspection.  
- On days when I was paralyzed, I'd say to AI: _"Give me one small thing I can do to move forward."_ And it would.  

It was no replacement for human connection, but when I felt alone in my issues, **AI was a constant voice of reason, reminding me that I wasn't**.

## From Survival to Innovation: Building with AI

Once I had control back, I started **building**. AI was not just a toolâ€”it was the foundation of what I did.

### **FinanAI: AI-Driven Investment Strategies**

I co-founded **FinanAI**, an AI-driven investment platform that analyzes market trends, predicts risks, and optimizes financial portfolios.

#### How AI-Prompt Engineering Helped:

- **Predictive Modeling**: AI-driven feature selection allowed us to calibrate financial models, removing noise and improving decision-making.  
- **Automated Insights**: Instead of spending hours poring over trends, I trained AI prompts to summarize market moves in seconds.  
- **User Education**: We developed a data-backed AI assistant that helps investors make informed decisions, bridging the gap between knowledge and accessibility.  

FinanAI wasn't just an ideaâ€”it was a **merge of AI and finance**, leveraging machine learning to bring investment strategies to the masses.

### **SchoolBag: The Focus Assistant for ADHD Minds**

Unsatisfied with traditional productivity tools, I developed **SchoolBag**â€”a focus assistant specifically designed for neurodivergent learners.

#### How AI-Prompt Engineering Helped:

- **Customized Task Scheduling**: AI-created personalized focus sessions based on attention patterns.  
- **Distraction Control**: Contextual reminders got users back on track when they lost direction.  
- **Gamified Learning**: AI-crafted live study challenges made learning engaging.  

SchoolBag wasn't merely a productivity app; it was about **embracing how our brains worked and optimizing them, rather than forcing traditional methods that didn't fit**.

## AI Didn't Just Assist Meâ€”It Transformed Me

Looking back, **AI-Prompt Engineering didn't just help me accomplish things; it transformed my mind**.

It **took my flaws and turned them into strengths**. It made me a builder, a problem solver. It gave me control over the chaos.

And now, as I proceed to the next step toward my **Harvard Master's**, I know one thing for certain:

ðŸš€ **AI isn't replacing human creativity. It's enhancing it.**  

And I am living proof of it.
